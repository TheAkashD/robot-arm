# robot-arm
Arduino robot arm using 4 servo motors and 4 potentiometers.

Power usage:
  - Arduino can just be connected to mains or PC power
  - Separate power required for motors: 4 * 1.5 AAs works well, = 6V.
  - SG90 servo motor functional voltage range is 4.8V -> 6V 
  
NOTE: if there is an issue, then it is most likely to be power related.

Mechanics: 
  - replaced the servo with the worn out gear which slipped frequently.
